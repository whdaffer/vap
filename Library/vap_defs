# $Id$
# Generic Defaults for Vap Processing.
# Currently, the only defaults in this file is where to send error messages.
#
# =============== With a little more work, can be obsoleted! ================
#
# See the TODO file. The defaults defined in this file have been moved
# to other objects, but some still `use' VapUtil.pm, so just to make
# sure nothing breaks I'm going to leave this file where it is.
# 
# To make it go away completely, just go through those objects which
# `use' VapUtil.pm and remove the dependencies.
