#                                             SeaWinds data, use

#                               the string that will actually be used is 
#                               'Overlay for the `NAME', so chose the string wisely.
#                    ACTIVE => 0|1 } # 1 means put on website.
# 		}
#
#
#
#
#
# Note 1: The region 'designation' is the string (all caps) you put behind the 
#         '--region' option. It is the way the software gets at the info in 
#         this data structure. If you mistype, the software will fail.
#
#         This designation also serves as the name in the overlay
#         webpages. For example: the left hand Nav bar on every page
#         will have an href like for the N.E. pacific (ir4) that looks
#         like `overlay_qs.html#GOES10_4_NEPAC_1' which takes the
#         viewer directly to that portion of the overlay page with
#         QuikSCAT data data with the N.E. Pacific Goes 10, ir4 view.
#
# Note 2: The asctime/desctime are the default times for this
# overlay. In the abscence of any other time info, i.e. the option
# --time is not included on input, the software will retrieve the
# goes/gms file which is closest to whichever of these two times
# preceeds the current time. For example, if this software is called thusly,
#
# Note 3: All times are in GMT!
# 
#
# Note 4: The meaning of the WEB->{ACTIVE} and {INSTRUMENT} fields. 
#
#         Since the webpage is completely rewritten each time a new
#         product is created, some way is required to convey
#         information to the Web side of the processing )See
#         VapWebsite.pm) which regions are actually on the list of
#         those actively being produced by the automated
#         processing. That's what these fields are meant to do.
#
#         These fields are used to communicate to the VapWebsite.pm
#         object which overlay regions are being actively created, and
#         therefore, which to put in the webpages. They don't convey
#         any information about which overlays for regions actually
#         get created, they don't control the calls to the creation
#         routines. That's controlled entirely by which instances of
#         the creation routine `make_overlay' are occur in the VAP
#         account crontab.
#
#         The field WEB->{ACTIVE} key is one way to turn on/off the
#         Web processing associated with the region. If WEB->{active}
#         == 0, this region won't appear in either the left hand
#         navigation bar or the webpage devoted to that region for
#         either SeaWinds on QuikSCAT or ADEOS-II. 
#
#         Finer control is gained using the hash->{INSTRUMENT}
#         array. Here you can turn off the creation of this slot on
#         the webpage for the overlay of this particular region, but
#         only for, say, SeaWinds on QuikSCAT data, while still
#         creating a slot for the overlays made using SeaWinds on
#         ADEOS-II alone.
#
#         The {WEB}->{ACTIVE} key is primarily meant to communicate
#         the usefulness of the cloud data associated with this view,
#         while the {INSTRUMENT} key is meant to communicate which
#         wind data to use. Generally one would expect the information
#         used in these keywords will be more `global,' i.e. if we
#         decide not to make an overlay of a particular region using
#         SeaWinds on QuikSCAt data, we'll most likely decide not to
#         make ANY overlays using that wind data. By the same token,
#         if we decide not to make overlays in the Japan region using
#         GMS5 data, we'll decide not to make overlays of *any* region
#         where GMS5 is the only cloud data available, presumably
#         because of problems with that instrument/satellite. However,
#         I don't want to prejudge the situation, so I've coded for
#         the possibility of other scenarios that require a finer
#         level of control on which wind/cloud data to use.
#
#         However, there's no code (at the moment: Fri Dec 13 11:01:53
#         2002) in the actual creation routines (see make_overlay and
#         Overlay.pm) that explicitly disallows making overlays in
#         regions where these fields say the automated processing
#         isn't being done: I don't want to completely restrict the
#         ability to make overlays in these regions, just restrict the
#         attention of the Web processing objects. This way, I
#         believe, maintains the most flexibility.
#
#         One can always remove, or comment out, a region from this
#         hash, that makes it completely unavailable to the automated
#         processing. Or, you can set WINDS->{instruments} to an empty
#         array, ([]) or to '0'; this will accomplish the same purpose
#         but maintain this region in case you later change your mind.
#
#         Conversely, to start including overlays on the webpage that
#         are created but haven't been, as yet, put on the webpage,
#         one must make the relevent modification to one or both of
#         these fields.
#
#
# auto_goes_overlay --region GOES10_4_NEPAC_1 
#
#  at anytime between 07:01 and 19:59 hours (GMT), the software will use the time 
#  contained in AscTime, otherwise it will use DescTime.
