1. Get rid of all dependencies on VapUtil.pm!
 
   Very little code depends on VapUtil anymore, but there are those
   last little niggling dependencies I haven't gotten rid of yet, so I
   can't take out the 'use VapUtil' statements until I do! Which means
   I can't get rid of the obsolete vap_defs file, since VapUtil.pm
   `requires' it. The only thing in there are the email addresses to
   send error email and that functionality has been taken over by the
   VapError.pm object, which has its own default file. So, until the
   last dependencies to VapUtil are removed, we have to carry around
   both the module and its defaults file.
