Regarding the *.template files. These are for those files expected to
change little except on long time scales. Each .template file has a
corresponding .html file in the VAP website, which is created in much
the same manner as the dynamic pages except that the 'body' of the
webpage is inserted verbatim from the corresponding .template
file. This means that these files must contain valide HTML code.

To change one of this sort of files in the website, edit the html code
in the correct .template file, then run update_website with the
basename of the file as the argument. For example, if you want to
change status.html, edit status.template then run

% update_website STATUS

The website running code assumes that the .template file is in the
directory pointed to by the environmental variable VAP_LIBRARY.
