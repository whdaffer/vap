Finish work on the cloud_overlay, replacing the obsolescent Gms5.pm 
with the object oriented OGms5.pm.  Test thoroughly.                    1 day

Test make_animation 							1 day

If possible: put logic in OGms5.pm that determines which grid
directory to use, that way we don't have to FTP both grid/grida 
files									??
