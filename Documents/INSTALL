  You must check to make sure the \$VAP_CONFIG/.vaprc and
 \$VAP_CONFIG/.vapidlrc files have all the variables are 
  defined correctly

  Variables to look out for:

  -- \$VAP_SFTWR_IDL_EXTERNAL
  -- \$VAP_SFTWR_IDL_COMMON

  These point to areas of IDL code that weren't stored in; the CVS
  archives, so they aren't under configuration management, they're
  just code I've accumulated over the years and didn't have heart to
  go through and figure out what I didn't want to keep.

  In particular, make sure \$VAP_CONFIG points to the right place,
  since it's what defines all the other variables.

  Also, have a care for the file $VAP_CONFIG/release. That's defines
  where the software tree starts (except for ...IDL_COMMON and
  ...IDL_EXTERNAL, of course). It's meant to allow one to quickly
  switch the processing between different 'releases' each of which is
  beneath a properly designated tree. Right now, I'm just using the
  CVS tag as the `release.' You can, of course, change or do away with
  this feature entirely, simply by editing VAP_CONFIG/.vaprc, if you
  wish, but have a care if you don't. Since all the other variables
  are going to have the contents of that file included in their
  definitions, provided the file exists and is non-empty. If this
  isn't true, the default `release' is 'default', unless you
  eliminiate this from the \$VAP_CONFIG/.vaprc file.

  When you've done these things, run
  release/create_run_environment. This will create all the working
  directories and the WWW directories, as defined by the enbironmental
  variables contained in \$VAP_CONFIG/.vaprc. It will also populate
  the part of the website that's relatively static, i.e. the images
  directory and the various static webpages.

   Then the only thing you need to do is start up the processing by
  setting up the crontab files.
